Despite the integrated AI it is still unable to accurately interpret the use of a part and is not always fully accurate, sometimes melding components of similar make together.",153

It later became apparent that, with very little modification, the suite was able to overwrite neural pathways, allowing for direct knowledge insertion, memory edits, or full personality transfers.",154

They are not infallible, often fixing parts that were not broken - but they are still leaps and bounds beyond anything currently found in the sector.",157

The drones adjust themselves to current tasks, getting reclaimed and rebuilt constantly - it can even build hyperspace capable drone carriers. 

There is no control interface, and while it seems to have the ability to disassemble as well as gather salvage, it only does the latter, with no obvious way to change the mode.

The uncanny ability to adapt to any situation would be alarming if it wasn't so very useful.",158
