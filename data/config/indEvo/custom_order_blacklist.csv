# NOTES
# Blacklist for Requisitions Center
# Factions on this list will not have their weapons for sale/order by the structure.
# Custom order for a friendly entity would be supported by even the most hostile factions - so only extremely reclusive factions should be on this list
"# If your faction has an open, unregulated market it sells weapons on, there is no reason to blacklist it here"

"#In-campaign toggle: Set !!faction!! memory key ""$IndEvo_customOrderAllowed"". True = allowed (even if on this list), false = prohbited (even if not on this list)."
