Printing Defects,IndEvo_print_med,,,,dmod,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,indevo.industries.derelicts.hullmods.PrintDefectsMed,"This hull has the telltale signs of automated construction - Steel plates where there should not be any, doors welded to their frames, metal beams crossing through corridors and constant minor issues plague this ship.

Major Printing Defects,IndEvo_print_high,,,,dmod,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,indevo.industries.derelicts.hullmods.PrintDefectsHigh,"This hull bears heavy marks of automated construction - Faulty bulkheads, leaking atmosphere and entire inaccessible sections due to scanning and construction errors. It is a prime example of why this technology was not established before the collapse.

Few ships are created this way due to their notorious reliability issues, and the ones that are even remotely serviceable are usually not pressed into military service, rather serving as esotheric collectors' pieces.",,graphics/hullmods/printing_defects.png
