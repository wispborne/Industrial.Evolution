Mobile colony ship

Roadmap
- Create move-able fleet colony (assign colony to fleet entity)
    - while deployed, we'll just have it be a normal entity with a market
    - while mobile, intercept dialogue and fake the colony screens
    - make count as station!!
X Implement model with trails (it should be flying around its orbit when in deployed mode)
- Implement actual ship (fuck)
- Create two mode toggle (via dialogue for now)
 - When stationary, full colony access and behaviour
 - when mobile, can't build anything, can't manage - how to prohibit?
    - just make it not player owned, check how nex does autonomous colonies
    - make sure to still add the upkeep/income to the report somehow
    - add an invisible entity in a fake system with the actual market on it while it is mobile in hyperspace
    - when any UI tab is open, add colony to ship as usual so it shows up correctly (location ect)
- Give upgradeable attributes to fleet
    - add limited cargo functionality
- create Escort hangar and escort deployment function (sharing cargo with fleet storage)
- add slot blockers
- add ship movement AI (Follow, stay, goto)
- Create ship management UI (load UI via side panel when interacting)
 - upgrading
 - navigation
 - exploration button (disable for now)
- Create exploration framework
    - add test event
- Create exploration UI
- fill in events, story line and industry choices

Two modes:
    - Mobile
        - Movement modes:
            - Stay
            - Summon
            - Follow
            - Move to location
        - While mobile, can explore, but no management, upgrades halted
        - No artillery while moving
        - Hyperspace Travel reduces stability slowly
                - Stops player from moving it with him all the time, cheesing the game
                - Staying stationary replenishes it fast (because deploying takes a while anyway)
    - Deployed
        - Unlocks colony management, upgrades, cargo management ect
        - Allows arty to fire (when unlocked)
    - Toggling between modes takes more time the more upgrades you have
        - 7 to 31 days
        - Upgrade option to shorten that time

Features
- Upgrades to each aspect
    - Departments
        - Pop Size
        - Engine (Burn)
        - Storage & Hangar capacity (limited, never infinite)
        - Artillery (weaponry)
        - Infrastructure (unlock building slots)
        - Deployment time reduction
    - Upgrades are done with money and commodities
    - High tier upgrades need industry items as input
- Colony Management
    - Unlock building slots for structures and Industries
        - Require population, resources and exploration progress to unlock
    - "Build out" your colony
        - After exploring an area, secure it and establish infrastructure
        - Prerequisite to pop size increase
    - Establish law / make choices that impact stability, production, growth, exploration and possible events
    - Specify escort ships for the colony
        - Specific Submarket (Hangar) - ships in there get deployed to the colony fleet
    - Management events
        - Department X wants to secede, allow them, or deploy marines
            - Once! Only after enough upgrades unlocked
            - if denied and brutally beat down, add stab penalty and try again with different department after some time
            - Add open market and tribute payment
            - Lose upgrade ability for one area
            - Subjugate them to get rid of benefits and unlock upgrade again

        - Maybe later on:
              - Crew of [Ship in Hangar] wishes to [Escort Colony - Go with you - Move out on their own - Stay on planet X (in storage)]
                    - Limited amount of time on the actions (2 months? 3?)
                    - Allowing gives PPT boost for a year
                    - Rejecting does nothing because cost of opportunity included in choice
              - If military laws: X crew in storage wishes to become marines
              - If civilian laws: X marines in storage wish to lay down weapons
              - X crew want to build themselves a ship (frig/dest, special hullmod, lotsa d-mods)
              - Population needs material X/Y for stuff, provide within X months or -1 stab, if provided, +1 growth?
- Exploration
    - Make visual GUI, timeline-like, for "rooms", newest on top, scroll down for older
    - Most upgrades are locked behind exploration
        - One exploration party, 2 later on to avoid swamping player with events
        - Dispatch to specific area in ship ("upgrade path")
        - Recall to center to re-deploy to different area
        - Exploration unlocks upgrades, exploring the area is the requirement for each upgrade level
            - Ex.: You explored a few rooms engine, now you want to explore cargo for more space: redeploy squad
        - Establish base camp (takes "1 Turn", saves progress if you wipe or redeploy)
            - Can deploy marines to base camp for fast access if you die
        - Dying
            - If you lose all marines, you have to re-tread the non-built-out-rooms, which takes time
            - If you already built out all the explored rooms, it takes no time
            - Re-Deploying from local base camp is faster
            - Maybe morale/stability penalty?
    - Dispatch a marine party to explore the ship
        - Combat
            - Hostile drones
            - Hostile Tribe
            - Bandits
            - Environment
            - Failed experiments (animals, plants, fungi)
            - Cosmic Horror
            - Nanites
            - Automatic defenses
            - Betrayal / Mutiny
        - Diplomacy
            - AI
            - Friendly tribe
            - Scavengers
            - Descendants of builders
            - Stranded spacer crew
            - Sentient plant
        - Simple choices
            - Move to next area X or Y
            - Follow screams
            - Rest to Heal or press on
            - Examine machine, fiddle with it, dismantle it
            - Find old ship, fix up?
        - Lore
            - Where do we come from, where do we go?
            - Gonna make some 5head shit yo
            - Maybe a small story line for each department?
    - Find rewards during exploration like metal or food stores, items ect later
    - Should take some time to go through each event, total duration 4 cycles (?? - will need playtesting)
