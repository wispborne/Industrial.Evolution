     Hostile deciv. SubPop

     can happen anywhere, increased spawn chance on planets with deciv subPop
     they block you from salvaging their house
     Either:    Blow them up with fuel (destroys extra finds)
                Clear them with marines (can find extra goodies)




     chance to get pointed to a good system for a colony
     Sacrifice a ship to get its DP x5 in supplies
     choose 1 of 3 hulls, pay its DP cost x 5 (?) in supplies, get the ship with D-mods (ship quality depending on forge, starting with none = scrapheap)
     Repair a certain amount of D-Mods by sacrificing a degraded nanoforge

     somebody's notes? To like say, the location of hidden caches
       (I hid an onslaught/weapon cache here... I hid an onslaught in an asteroid here, gotta remember to go get it back later...)
       (Or just XIV stuff since IIRC the heg was forced to mothball their shit on the way to the sector)

     maybe intel that leads to a bounty with a higher-than normal value?
        "Data from the ship's databanks reveals that so and so wears socks with slippers. Turning this intel in to the fashion police will result in a bounty with a higher payout."

     A datachip with somebody's old bank account details ("You empty the old spacer's bank account, as well as 50 years of compound interest.")
       variation: someones current bank details, results in a visit from an unhappy fleet

     secret data send it to chosen faction get some rep (send it to one of either, get rep with them and lose it with the other, or sell it for pirate rep)

     Old AI core is very lonely, asks you to take them with you (will join as AI officer)
        Or disconnect it to gain a A/B/G core, depending on officer level
        Or blow it up for no reward
        if 1 or 2 case: chance to steal a low DP (sub-10) frigate and run off, if player has one

     Negative
     pay X supplies or the station will self destruct without loot
