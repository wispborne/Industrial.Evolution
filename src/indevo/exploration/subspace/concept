make station spawn around black holes and neutrons
requires repair:
    10000 metal
    3000 Heav Mach
    3000 ship components
    500 relic components

allows building subspace access points on stable locations within 12LY around it
    subspace access points
    100 Relic Components
    1000 metal
    100 machine

Station requires constant stream of fuel to operate
if demand of 8 is not met, access points do not work
requires an item on the planet that's producing fuel, "Nellys' Key"

Subspace
subspace is a scaled, relative hyperspace layer that is smaller
is a mirror of hyperspace, spawn massive black holes where omega is present
spawn hyperspace exits to the stable location nodes the player built
moving particles in geometric patterns that get affected by player movement (Bugwelle im Wasser), render only on viewport
Make particles agitated and slow movement on routes travelled often
Cooldown should be in the months
